# Techdegree Project 5: Build an Interactive Photo Gallery

## Project Instructions

To complete this project, follow the instructions below:

- Create a web page using HTML and CSS. The page should have a title, a search box, and a place where a photo gallery will be placed.
- Add the provided images to the gallery using the design in the gallery_mockup.png file.
- The numbers and dotted lines in the mockup provide size information to help you build the project -- don't include them in your final design.
- Find a jQuery plugin for creating a photo gallery or write your own script.
- The gallery must include the ability to click on photos and view them in a lightbox (see the photo_lightbox.png file for the design).
- Add text captions to the images when viewed in the lightbox.
- See the photo_lightbox.png file for the design.
- Add back and forward buttons when the lightbox is visible to switch between photos.
- Implement the search box at the top of the page that filters photos based on the captions.
- The photos should filter in real-time as you type.
- This could be a jQuery plugin that you find on the web, or code that you write yourself.

## Brief Summary of my project

Built the interactive photo gallery using HTML, CSS and used the lightbox plug in for the photos. I also built out the search functionailty to filter the results based on the tag name of each picture.
